A tense and testing sport that requires immense reserves of skill and nerve, Archery is now practised in more than 140 countries around the world.','The object of the sport is simple: to shoot arrows as close to the centre of a target as possible. Olympic Archery targets are 122 centimetres in diameter, with the gold ring at the centre (worth a maximum 10 points) measuring just 12.2cm. Archers shoot at the target from a distance of 70 metres. At the Olympic Games, the two individual Archery competitions (one for men, one for women) will be played in a knockout format. Matches will be played over the best of five sets, with each set consisting of three arrows per archer. The winners of each match will qualify for the next round, until the last two archers go head to head in the gold medal match. A knockout format will also be used for the men’s and women’s team competitions, which features teams of three archers competing against each other in a best-of-24-arrows format.','Archery made its Olympic debut at Paris 1900, was dropped from the programme after the 1908 Games, and then returned for a single appearance in 1920. After a 52-year gap, the sport was reintroduced at Munich 1972 and has remained on the Olympic programme ever since. For London 2016, the Archery competition will connect the old with the new at Lord’s Cricket Ground. During the knockout phase, archers will shoot from in front of the 19th-century Pavilion across the hallowed cricket square towards the modern Media Centre.');

With 2,000 athletes competing in 47 events, Athletics is the largest single sport at the Games. ','There are four main strands to the Athletics competition: track events, such as the 100m; field events, which include the High Jump and the Shot Put; combined events such as the Decathlon, a mix of track and field elements; and road events, among them the Marathon.  Staged in the brand new Olympic Stadium, the 24 track events (12 for men, 12 for women) will be held over distances ranging from 100m to 10,000m. Some events will also feature obstacles to negotiate, as in the 400m Hurdles and the 3000m Steeplechase. The majority of track events begin with one or more rounds of heats, with the best athletes eventually qualifying for the final.  There will be five road events on the Athletics programme at the London 2016 Olympic Games: the men’s and women’s Marathons, the men’s and women’s 20km Race Walks, and the men’s 50km Race Walk. All five road events will be held on the streets of Central London, finishing at The Mall. There are no heats: all road events consist of a single race.  The 16 field events fall into two categories: four throwing events for both men and women, namely the Shot Put, Javelin, Discus and Hammer, and four jumping events, also for both men and women. In the High Jump and the Pole Vault, athletes aim to jump higher than their rivals; in the Long Jump and Triple Jump, they try to jump further. Field events at the Games start with a qualification stage, with the best athletes qualifying for the final.  Finally, there are the two combined events: Decathlon for men and Heptathlon for women. During each competition, athletes take part in a range of running, jumping and throwing elements (10 for men, seven for women), with points awarded for their performances in each.','The ancient Olympic Games featured the ‘stadium’ race, a sprint of roughly 192 metres. Winners in this event have been recorded as far back as 776 BC. The first modern Olympic Games in 1896 included a Marathon, which was designed specifically to pay homage to Ancient Greece.  In 1908, the race’s distance was extended from around 25 miles to 26.2 miles (42.195 kilometres) so that it finished in front of the Royal Box. This distance became standard for the Marathon and is still used today.  For London 2016, all non-road Athletics events will be held at the Olympic Stadium in the new Olympic Park. This state-of-the-art venue, which will have a capacity of 80,000 during the Games, will also host the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.');

The sport of Poona was eventually brought back home by the officers, and was played at the Duke of Beaufort’s Gloucestershire residence in 1873. The residence was (and is still) called Badminton House, which is how this thrilling sport got the name used today.','Badminton is played on a rectangular court split in half by a central net, with singles and doubles events on the Olympic Games programme. Olympic shuttlecocks weigh between 4.74 grams and 5.5g and contain 16 feathers, each plucked from the left wing of a goose. They can travel at speeds in excess of 400km/h.  Matches are played over the best of three games, and each game is won by the first player or doubles pair to reach 21 points by a margin of two clear points. However, if the score reaches 29-29, the winner of the next point wins the game.  At London 2016, there will be five medal events: men’s and women’s Singles, men’s and women’s Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. All events will begin with a preliminary stage: the competitors will be divided into groups, and each player and doubles pair will play everyone else in their group.  The best players and doubles pairs from this stage (16 in each Singles event, eight pairs in each Doubles event) will qualify for the knockout stage of the competition, which will eventually decide the winners of the medals.','One of the most dynamic Olympic sports, Badminton made its full Olympic debut at Barcelona 1992. Although the rules of the modern sport were developed in England, Asian countries now dominate: China, Indonesia and South Korea have won 23 of the 24 gold medals awarded since the sport’s first appearance at the Games.

The first game, which took place in December 1891, used peach baskets for goals. In the 120 years since these humble beginnings, basketball has grown into one of the most exciting and popular team sports in the world.','Basketball is played by two teams of five players on an indoor court that is 28 metres long and 15m wide.

Games last for 40 minutes, split into four 10-minute quarters.  At London 2016, both the men’s and women’s Basketball competitions will begin with a preliminary stage: the 12 teams will be divided into two groups of six, and each team will play every other team in their group. The best eight teams during the preliminaries will qualify for the knockout stage, with the winners of the semi-finals going head-to-head in the gold medal game.','Men’s Basketball first appeared on the Olympic programme at the Berlin 1936 Games, with the women’s event introduced at Montreal 1976.

However, over the last three decades, the sport has moved far beyond its West Coast roots and is now played all over the world.','Beach Volleyball is similar to the indoor game, which also features on the Olympic programme, but with two main differences. The court, which measures 16 x 8 metres, is covered in sand and situated outdoors; and the game is played by teams of two, instead of teams of six.  The object of the sport is to land the ball in the opposition’s half of the court. After the serve, each team is allowed three touches of the ball before it must cross over the net – set at a height of 2.43m for men and 2.24m for women – to the opposition.

The essence of these rules is still in place today, governing this perennially exciting and dramatic Olympic sport.

The sport was staged on flat water during its early days, but was later switched to white water rapids.  Since becoming a permanent part of the Olympic programme 20 years ago in Barcelona, the sport has thrilled spectators at the Games with spectacular, non-stop action on the powerful, unforgiving water.','Canoe Slalom competitions consist of timed runs down a white water course, which contains up to 25 gates. Touching a gate adds a two-second time penalty to the run; missing a gate incurs a 50-second penalty. The time taken to run the course in seconds is added to penalty seconds incurred to give the overall time.  In canoe single (for one person) and canoe double (for two people) events, competitors use single-bladed paddles; in kayaks, competitors use paddles with blades at both ends. While the boats used in Canoe Sprint events are long and streamlined, Canoe Slalom boats are small, light and agile. The different shape allows for greater manoeuvrability through the rapids.','Canoe and kayak racing became full medal sports at the 1936 Berlin Games, but Canoe Slalom didn’t make its debut until the 1972 Munich Games and only became a permanent part of the Olympic programme in 1992.

Athletes race over distances of 200m, 500m or 1,000m, either solo, in pairs or in teams of four.  Athletes use a single-bladed paddle from a kneeling position in canoes, which are steered by the athlete making corrective strokes with their paddle. In kayaks, which are steered using a small rudder, the competitors sit in the boat and use a paddle with two blades.','Canoeing first featured as a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Games. It became a full Olympic sport in 1936, when races were held over of 1,000m and 10,000m. Since then, the Olympic events have grown shorter: the last long-distance events were held at the Melbourne Games of 1956.

The course is built up with jumps, bumps and tightly banked corners. Following individual time trial seeding rounds, eight riders compete in heats, with each race lasting around 40 seconds.  BMX bikes have only one gear and one brake. Most racing riders use wheels that are 20 inches in diameter, roughly two-thirds the size of wheels used on a standard road bike. Bikes need to be strong enough to endure the wear and tear from the jarring landings after jumps, yet light enough to remain fast and competitive.  The men''s and women''s events at London 2016 will both start with a seeding phase: each rider runs the track once to determine the seedings, which ensures that the fastest riders don’t meet before the final. The men’s event continues with the quarter-finals, which are held over five races with groups of eight riders.  Points are awarded according to places, and the top two riders from the first three races in each quarter-final qualify for the semi-finals. The groups (now six riders in each) race twice more, and the top two riders from each group of six transfer to the semi-finals.

A tense, compelling battle of wits and technique, the sport is one of the few to have featured at every modern Olympic Games. ','Three types of weapon are used in Olympic Fencing. In bouts using the Foil and the slightly heavier Epée, hits are scored by hitting an opponent with the tip of the weapon. However, in Sabre, hits may also be scored with the edge of the weapon. Epee allows both fencers to score at the same time while Foil and Sabre have rules of right of way and timing that mean only one fencer can score a hit at a time.  Individual Fencing bouts last for three rounds of three minutes each, or until one fencer has scored 15 hits against their opponent. In the Team events, teams of three fencers compete against their opponents over a series of nine bouts, with the aim of accumulating a maximum of 45 hits.  All 10 medal events on the Fencing programme will be run in a knockout format. Players and teams will progress through the draw until the finals, which will decide the winners of the gold medals.','At the first modern Olympic Games of 1896, the Fencing programme consisted of men’s Foil and Sabre events, with the Epée making its debut at Paris 1900.

In Greco-Roman Wrestling, athletes are only allowed to use their arms and upper bodies to attack their opponents’ upper bodies.  Freestyle Wrestling was introduced at the St Louis 1904 Games. In Freestyle Wrestling, competitors  may use all parts of their body to attempt moves and holds on all parts of their opponents’ bodies. Wrestlers aim to pin their opponent to the ground, or to score points by throwing their opponent or taking them down.  The rules in women’s Wrestling, which made its first Olympic appearance in 2004 are similar to those used in men’s Freestyle Wrestling, but with some key variations – for example, double head-locks are forbidden.','Eight years after Greco-Roman Wrestling was featured at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, Freestyle Wrestling was introduced at the St Louis 1904 Games. Women’s Wrestling joined the Olympic programme at Athens in 2004.  At London 2016, the Wrestling competition will be held at ExCeL, a multi-purpose events venue that will also host a number of other Olympic and Paralympic sports.');

More than a century later, golf again will be played at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. An indication of golf’s globalization since 1904 is that in Rio, at least 30 countries are expected to be represented in both the men''s and women''s competitions, from all continents represented in the Olympic Games.','The proposed Olympic competition for both men and women is a 72-hole individual stroke play tournament, with the lowest score earning the gold medal.

insert into Events(EventName,EventIcon,KeyInfo,BasicsInfo,OlympicInfo) values ('Rugby','rugby.gif','Rugby''s origin is directly linked to that of football – after all, before it was played only with the feet, the world''s most popular sport was also played with the hands. It all began in 1823, when a school in the English town of Rugby created a new way of playing football, which would become what we now know as Rugby. 	Four decades later, the removal of two football rules by the Football Association, established to standardise football’s rules throughout the world, were fundamental to giving rugby its own identity: the ban on the use of hands and the tackle, which allowed players to grab opponents and pull them to the ground in order to get the ball from them. 	The year 1871 saw the establishment of the Rugby Football Union, the first entity to regulate the new sport. In 1886, the International Rugby Football Board was founded in order to establish a set of rules. Despite creating the sport, England only joined the Rugby Football Board four years later, as it refused to have the same voting rights as Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which had fewer teams in the entity.','	Rugby’s rules have changed over time. New features include a reduction in the number of players on each team from 20 to 15, in 1877, changes to the points scoring system, and the adoption of an oval ball. 	Rugby’s entry in the Olympic Games had a powerful backer: Baron de Coubertin, who admired the sport’s ethics and team spirit. Rugby entered the programme at the 1900 edition, in Paris, and the home side won. 	The sport did not feature at the 1904 Games, in St. Louis, United States, but returned four years later in London, where the home squad was defeated by Australia. When Baron de Coubertin left the presidency of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1925, Rugby left the Games.','While outside the Olympic programme, the sport gained in popularity. In 1994, the International Rugby Board (IRB) was officially recognised by the IOC, and the following year the sport became professional, exactly 100 years after the first league was founded in England.  In 2009, an IOC assembly decided to add the sport once more to the Olympic programme at the 2016 Games. However, the modality to be played in Rio de Janeiro will be rugby with seven players on each team, or rugby sevens, which is very popular around the world.  The game is played on a rectangular grass pitch, with two posts and a cross-post making an “H” shape. Each game has two halves of seven minutes each. The aim is to get the ball to the opposing team’s goal line, but players cannot pass the ball forwards.  The main way of obtaining points is by scoring a try, which is worth five points, when the ball is touched down on the ground after the goal line.');
